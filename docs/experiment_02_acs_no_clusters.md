# Experiment #2: ACS patients flow without classification

Implemented in [experiment_02_acs_no_clusters.py](experiment_02_acs_no_clusters.py)

## Experiment description

Simulation of patients with two flows: ACS patients from [ACS data without clustering](/data/acs_no_clusters/) and background flow for surgery facilities load with [surgery flow data](/data/surgeries/). To be compared with [Experiment #1](/docs/experiment_01_acs.md). Fixed parameters, single simulation for 2*365 days.
